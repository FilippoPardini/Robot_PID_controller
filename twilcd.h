/*
Remember that the TWI bus must have pull-up resistors on SDA and SCL.
We recommend 1.8K or 4.7K resistors.
The TWI must be initialized as in the example below. In the example
has been used TWID:

*****************************************************************************

#include <twilcd.h>
.  .  .

// TWI clock rate [bps]
#define TWI_CLK_RATE 100000

// structure that holds information used by the TWID master
// for performing a TWI bus transaction
TWI_MASTER_INFO_t twid_master;

interrupt [TWID_TWIM_vect] void twid_master_isr(void)
{
	twi_master_int_handler(&twid_master);
}

void main(void)
{
	unsigned char h,m,s;

	// general TWID initialization
	// no external driver interface
	// no SDA hold time
	twi_init(&TWID,false,false);

	// initialize the TWID master
	twi_master_init(&twid_master,&TWID,TWI_MASTER_INTLVL_LO_gc,TWI_BAUD_REG(_MCU_CLOCK_FREQUENCY_,TWI_CLK_RATE));

	// set the LCD03 functions to use TWID
	lcd03_twi_init(&twid_master);

	// enable LO interrupt level
	PMIC.CTRL |= PMIC_LOLVLEN_bm;

	// enable interrupts
	#asm("sei")

	// now the rest of the LCD03 functions can be used

	// ....
}
